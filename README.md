## Setup and Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UdhyaKumarKMIT/StudentDataManagement-Spring-Boot-Restful-API.git
```

### Step 2: Check if your JDK version is suitable for the running the  project
if not upgrade your JDK to JDK 23 and Spring Boot version V3.3.5.
Ensure that you have all dependencies installed

### Step 3: Run the Application

You can run the application directly from your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) by running the `main` method in the `StudentDataManagementApplication.java` class.

Alternatively, run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start, and you can access the API and Swagger UI at:



### Step 5: Access Swagger UI

Once the application is running, you can open the Swagger UI to see and test all the available endpoints:

1. Open a web browser.
2. Enter  ```bash
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html```
3. You should see an interactive Swagger UI page with all available endpoints listed.

### Step 6: Testing Endpoints

Select Endpoint which you want to test and click Try this .

- **GET /students**: Retrieve all students.
- **POST /students**: Create a new student profile.
- **GET /students/{id}**: Retrieve a specific student profile by ID.
- **PUT /students/{id}**: Update a student profile.
- **DELETE /students/{id}**: Delete a student profile.
